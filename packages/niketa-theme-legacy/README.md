## Naming conventions

Replace `foo, bar, baz` with their equally irrelevant substitutes.

```
group themes by background:


`Advanced` for bright early day themes

`Brave` for mild themes

`Circus`  for darker mild themes

`Niketa` for after sunset themes
```

## Name

Niketa is the name I gave to my dog. On this picture, she is about 90 days:

![niketa](https://github.com/selfrefactor/niketa-themes/blob/master/packages/niketa-theme-legacy/blob/master/fscreen/niketa.jpg?raw=true)

And here she is about 1 year old.

## Develop

I build the themes by running `createPalleteTheme.spec.js` with `publish` flag set to `false`. I change some colors and then I enter debug mode.

Debug mode will open 22 themes, so the developer can choose which variation looks the best.

## Zeppelin themes

Tre color spin-off from `Niketa` themes.

All themes use three colors schema and use one of two light backgrounds.

Git diff colors are blue and ochra similar to the ones suggested in the article [Your syntax highlighter is wrong](https://jameshfisher.com/2014/05/11/your-syntax-highlighter-is-wrong/)

## Niketa extension

I used the same name for a suite of tools for automatic run of `Jest` tests with coverage. If you are interested, then you can hop on one of the following:

- [Niketa docs](https://github.com/selfrefactor/niketa)

There is `VSCode` part and `node` client part. On each save of file `foo.js`, it will run `foo.spec.js`. It will do that also if `foo.spec.js` has been saved.

- [The case against Wallaby](https://ilearnsmarter.wordpress.com/2018/12/22/the-case-against-wallaby-js/) `Niketa` is created as frustration with some cons of `Wallaby.js`. The link leads to an article where I try to compare both tools and explain more about the benefits of `Niketa` as `Jest` tool.
